# Deep Learning Notes
This repository will contain all of my notes of deep learning.
## Sources
Whenever I am learning something new, I always find it wise to compile a list of study material before diving in head first. Here are the resources I used below:
### Courses
- [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/): Top-down teaching approach by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas. 
### Textbooks
- [Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.ca/Deep-Learning-Ian-Goodfellow/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=deep+learning&qid=1630896121&sr=8-1): Written by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, this book covers the mathematical underpinnings of deep learning topics.
